Event Bubbling --> happens when element receives an event and that event bubbles upto its ancestor.
Event Capturing --> happens when a nested child receives an event then event of its parent must be called first before its event.
In event cycle first capturing happens and then bubbling and bubbling is by default.
It will apply on elements which are involved.
