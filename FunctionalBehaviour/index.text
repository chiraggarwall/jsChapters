How functions work in JS?
---
var x=1;
a();
b();
console.log(x);

fucntion a(){
    var x=10;
    console.log(x);
}

fucntion a(){
    var x=10;
    console.log(x);
}

During the 2nd phase of execution context when function get executed a new execution context is created & every execution context have their own memory space .


Shortest program in js ?
---When program runs global object get created which is window ("this" points to it).
